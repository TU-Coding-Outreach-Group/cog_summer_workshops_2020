    "# General Information\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are open access datasets?\n",
    "Open access datasets are datasets that are free and accessible to \"anyone\". These datasets have been collected by a group of researchers who have decided to share their data with the scientific community in order to promote openness, reproducibility, and more research by allowing their datasets to be reused instead of being locked away on some hard drive. Typically, one must register to a website which hosts the data and create an account where they agree to the dataset's term of use. There may be an approval process that you need to go through before you receive access. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of open access datasets: \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Datasets that are from a single group/study.__ These are studies that are just like any other a lab would run. The researchers finish their typical data collection and upload the data to a repository after their paper is published.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Large multi-site projects.__ These are datasets that come from multiple labs/researchers that are combined into a single dataset and hosted together. Some of these datasets are combined \"post-hoc\", and were not originally collected with the goal being to combine them into a single dataset. Recently, there have been efforts to fully standardize data collection at the multiple sites with the intention of creating an open access dataset. These datasets are usually of higher quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why would I want to use an open access dataset?\n",
    "* Pros\n",
    "    * Large sample sizes - Open access datasets typically have very large sample sizes, as they are often multi-site studies.\n",
    "    * Free data collection\n",
    "    * Data can be very high quality, which many researchers might not be able to acquire themselves\n",
    "    * Data can come preprocessed\n",
    "    * Data (especially behavioral data) is usually clean\n",
    "* Cons\n",
    "    * Might not be able to test your specific hypotheses\n",
    "    * Some multi-side studies can be very troublesome\n",
    "    * Data can come preprocessed\n",

    "## Gaining access\n",
    "It turns out that \"open access\" is not as accessible as you would think. Typically, researchers will have to apply to gain access to a dataset. This can be done by signing up and creating an account for the dataset repository, or submitting an pseudo application in which you will have to say who you are and what you intend to use the data for. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop, we will focus on the young adult (original) HCP dataset. The following steps will help you gain access to this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an account on [ConnectomeDB](https://db.humanconnectome.org/app/template/Login.vm;jsessionid=5629BEC4DD00C13DB36AAD1C07677226).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Login with your connectomeDB account\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install the Aspera Connect plugin <img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2020/master/open-access-datasets/images/aspera_connect.PNG height=100 width=700 />\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Log back into [ConnectomeDB](https://db.humanconnectome.org/app/template/Login.vm;jsessionid=5629BEC4DD00C13DB36AAD1C07677226) and accept the usage terms.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Download the behavioral and Freesurfer structural data <img height=400 width=500 src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2020/master/open-access-datasets/images/hcp_download.PNG />\n",

    "\n",
    "## Logistical issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hosting the data\n",
    "Some datasets, like neuroimaging data, can be very, VERY large. For example, a single subject's MRI data from the young adult HCP is over 40GB. Multiple that by 1200 (or slighly less) subjects, and you get 48TB of data, which is impossible for a single computer to host. In addition, it would be inefficient to have multiple researchers in a lab all have the same (large) dataset on their personal computers. Instead, there are two options: 1) Find a server to host the data for you in a common space that is accessible to everyone, or 2) only download a subset of the data. For the young adult HCP data, our lab has gone with option 1 and has teamed up with the computer science high performance cluster people at Temple to host the data on Owlsnest. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning the data\n",
    "Open access datasets may have variables that you are unfamiliar with, or that are named/abbreviated a specific way. To find out what variables are and what they aim to measure, refer to the dataset's data dictionary. Datasets may also come with documentation that describe what the dataset is, how it was acquired, how the data is structed and named. For imaging datasets, this is particularly important as the documentation will help you navigate directory structures to find the data you are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "# HCP Young Adult Behavioral Data\n",
    "For this workshop, we will explore the behavioral and Freesurfer structural data from the young adult HCP data. Once these have been downloaded, place them somewhere where you can access them via the command line. The data was not provided in this repo, as that may be breaking the dataset's terms of use."

    "# HCP Freesurfer Structural Data\n",
    "Next, we will explore the HCP Freesurfer data. Freesurfer is a neuroimaging program that specializes in structural analyses. The Freesurfer reconstruction pipeline takes in a standard T1 image and after about 12 hours of preprocessing, exports brain data related to various measures, tissues, parcellations, and stats. The benefit of the HCP data is that all of this work is done for you. If you wanted to do whole brain analyses, you could download the Freesurfer data for any subject and complete your own analyses. They HCP folks have also aggregated data on brain measures related to structural measures such as cortical thickness, surface area, and volume for all of the subjects, into a single spreadsheet. We will explore this data below."
