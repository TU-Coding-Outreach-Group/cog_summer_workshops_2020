# Description
This workshop will cover what open access datasets are, where to find them, and will provide some suggestions on how to deal with them. During the workshop, we will be playing around with some behavioral data from the Human Connectome Project. The workshop will go through the steps to obtain this dataset. 

# Prerequisites
* Basic knowledge of Jupyter Notebook
* Basic knowledge or R (syntax, importing data)

# To-do Before Workshop
1. Install the [R kernal](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/) for Jupyter. This will allow you to use R with Jupyter
2. Download the workshop material.
    1. This can be done manually by downloading the entire [COG Summer Workshops 2020 repo](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2020)
    2. Or you can use git:
        1. Open a bash terminal
        2. Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2020.git`
        3. Run the commands from [this post](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork), starting at step 3. After completing this steps, you will have updated your local repo with the materials from the cloud COG group github repo. 
        4. Now you should update your own github repo in the cloud, by pushing the local repo you have just updated. This can be done by the following commands when you are in the "cog_summer_workshops_2020" repo where all of the workshop materials are and the hidden .git file:
            1. `git add open-access-datasets`
            2. `git commit -m "update repo with new workshop materials` or whatever you want this message to be
            3. `git push`
