# PsychoPy Tutorial

## Description

This workshop will cover how to use [PsychoPy] (https://www.psychopy.org/index.html) to build psychological experiments using both the Builder and the Coder.

## Prerequisites

1. Basic knowledge of python (for the Coder portion - no experience required for the Builder!)
2. A computer with PsychoPy installed (see below for instructions on downloading)
3. It is recommended for the Coder portion that you have Anaconda downloaded, as well as a Python IDE (our recommendation is spyder, which comes with Anaconda)

## Before the Workshop

1. Install [PsychoPy] (https://www.psychopy.org/download.html) either through the command line, or as a standalone. There are instructions for both methods on the linked PsychoPy download page.
2. Install the required packages for the Coder portion of the workshop - 'pip install' random, os, PIL, pandas
3. Download the 'stim' folder from the TU COG Github. This is the folder containing the necessary files for creating our example tasks in both the Builder and Coder.
